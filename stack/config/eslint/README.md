## ‚ú® Features

This package offers opinionated but extensible **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)** configurations to align logical and stylistic rules across my projects.

It allows to:

- Make collaboration across my projects effective (including onboarding with a consistent look and writing patterns).
- Include a minimum viable and required set of rules to foster maintainable, testable, secure, and green code over time.
- Accelerate development by reusing common configuration and convention defaults.
